This is a simple design for a xt30 based power distribution block. 

It is sized to fit under the seat of a Husqvarna 701 enduro but is also handy in some other situations, like mini-lab. 

This uses XT30PW right angle surface mount connectors which are widely available and very strong. 

This assumes "male" will be hot as the contacts are protected and "female" will be cold as the contacts could allow shorting. As such there is a female input at the short side of the board and then all male outputs along the other edges.


If you just want one the .zip file here can be uploaded to a fab like jlcpcb and it contains the gerbers and drill files needed to have one made. the price is pretty reasonable.
